/*
  Express is one of the most popular frameworks for Node development. It handles
a number of common tasks for Node apps, and streamlines the development process.
In this chapter you learn how to install Express and create your first Express
app. You then set up routs to create the various paths your app needs.

  Next you create handlers for these routes that display views using Underscore
templates. By default, Express uses Jade templates, but you'll switch it to
Underscore so that you don't have to learn a new template language. Finally,
you handle posted from form data with a special POST route. You than validate
the form data, rendering messages for any errors that occur. If the form passes
validation, you send an email to the server administrator. By the end of this
chapter you'll be up and running with Express, and ready to build your own
Node app.
